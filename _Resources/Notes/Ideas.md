## Story:
The player, a bounty hunter, just got his biggest contract. Unfortunately, after catching up to his target his space ship gets shot down and crash lands on a prison mining colony. You need to gather the resources and items needed to repair his ship to finish his contract and get revenge for getting shot down. The mining colony is home to aliens creatures, robot and humanoid lowlifes, prisoners, and employees for the evil corporation in charge of the colony. As you explore more and finish more quests for people around the planet as well as missions for the corporation itself, you begin to learn more about why the corporation is mining on this planet. It turns out they are looking for a material only ever found on this planet. This material is a very powerful substance, capable of annihilating a whole solar system from anywhere in the galaxy. The corporation is looking to destory any planets or solar systems who do not bend a knee to them. Will you try and stop them or do you want to join them?

The player's ship lands in the middle of no where, no market or anything like that, like we discussed. You need to explore around and slowly upgrade your character, weapons, and resources stash. Until you finally get the credits and resources needed to repair your ship. However, you will be given a choice to stop the corporation at the end or join them. Both options gives you a last mission before you use your repaired ship and leave the planet.

Destroy the corporation final mission:
Lead an assault on there HQ on the planet and use the material to blow up the planet along with yourself.

Join the corporation final mission:
Help defend the HQ on the planet from a coalition trying to stop the shipment of the material to the corporation's home planet.

*The story and gameplay loop is HEAVILY inspired by [Dead Space](https://store.steampowered.com/app/17470/Dead_Space/), [Dark Souls](https://store.steampowered.com/app/374320/DARK_SOULS_III/), [Subnautica](https://store.steampowered.com/app/264710/Subnautica/), and [Chernobylite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016800/Chernobylite/)*
## Player Management Station (PMS):
### Differences Between **α** and **β** PMSs
All **α** stations have access to all modules and can allow the player to instantly transport to another pre-discovered **α** station. The **α** stations also are not place in areas where the player can get into combat. While **β** are only found in combat zones, most likely in loot rooms, to perform upgrades in the field, using resources only found in the field.

Both types of stations need to be activate to use and to be transported to. All stations have certain modules enabled, such as the Memory Module, allowing the player to save and load the game.

There is an **α** station inside your crash landed spaceship. However, you start with no other **α** stations activated; so you have to explore around.

*Inspired by Dead Spaces player upgrade stations, Dark Souls bonfires, and Subnautica 3D fabricators (3D printers).*

*Dark Souls III: Generic Bonfire, akin to **β** stations.*

*Dark Souls III: Firelink Bonfire, akin to **α** stations, has increased capabilities from generic bonfires.*

### Modules:
***α** - means that this module can be found at an **α** PMS*
***β** - means that this module can be found at a **β** PMS*
- #### Suit Module *(**α** + **β**)*
	- Upgrade shield, using credits or found resources
	- Permenant health upgrade, using credits or found resources
	- Movement speed upgrade, using credits or found resources
- #### Healing Module *(**α**)*
	- Allows the player to heal, maybe free of charge? Only found in town or maybe in particular places. Example: Dark Souls bonfire.
- #### Weapon Upgrade Module *(**α** + **β**)*
	- Upgrade equipped weapons, using credits or found resources
- #### Stash Module *(**α**)*
	- Upgrade stash size, using credits or found resources
	- Store resources found on missions
	- Store purchased weapons
- #### Transportation Module *(**α**)*
	- Travel between (?maybe already discovered?) α PMSs
- #### Mission Module *(**α** + **β**)*
	- Get missions from here, from other people on the planet, asking for your help
	- Turn in mission items.
- #### Market Module *(**α**)*
	- Use credits to purchase either single-use or multi-use files to print items. A weapon would be single-use, while a magazine for it would be a multi-use file.
	- Displays the resources needed to craft item, and compares resources on your character and your total resources including the stash.
- #### Crafting Module (**α** + **β**)
	- Allows the player to used purchased files, to print items, using found resources in inventory. Can also use resources found inside your stash if at an **α** station.
	-  Example: Subnautica, you essentially use a sci-fi 3D printer, to turn raw resources into usuable items. In our case the credits act as a fee to get access to the "file" of the item you want to print. The resources are the raw resources needed to print the item and are consumed upon crafting.
	- Recycler, break down found weapons and items, into 50% of there original resources used in they're printing.
- #### Memory Module *(**α** + **β**)*
	- Save the game.
	- Load another save.

### Example Items:
*Most Items are dropped by enemies. Basic weapons are somewhat common and can be recycled for more raw resources. While more powerful weapons are not dropped at all.*

*Directly inspired by Subnautica*
